Feature: Hr Application Database and UI data verification

Background:
	 Given I am on DeptEmpPage
	 

Scenario: Department data UI and Database verification
 When I search for department id 10
 And I query database with sql "SELECT department_name,manager_id,location_id from departments where department_id=10"
 Then UI data and Database data must match
 
 @HRAppDB 
 Scenario: Firstname and lastname search by email-UI vs DB verification
 When I search for email "JWHALEN" to see firstname and lastname
 And  I query database with sql "SELECT first_name,last_name FROM employees WHERE email='JWHALEN'"
 Then UI data and Database data must match
