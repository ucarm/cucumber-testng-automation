Feature: Hr Application Database and UI data verification

  Background: 
    Given I am on DeptEmpPage

  Scenario: Department data UI and Database verification
    When I search for department id 10
    And I query database with sql "SELECT department_name,manager_id,location_id from departments where department_id=10"
    Then UI data and Database data must match

  @HRAppDB
  Scenario Outline: Firstname and lastname search by email-UI vs DB verification
    When I search for email "<email>" to see firstname and lastname
    And I query database with sql "SELECT first_name,last_name FROM employees WHERE email='<email>'"
    Then UI data and Database data must match
    Examples:
    |email|
		|JWHALEN|
		|HBAER|
		|JRUSSEL|
